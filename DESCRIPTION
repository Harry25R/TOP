Description: TOP constructs a transferable model across gene expression platforms for prospective experiments. Such a transferable model can be trained to make predictions on independent validation data with an accuracy that is similar to a re-substituted model. The TOP procedure also has the flexibility to be adapted to suit the most common clinical response variables, including linear response, binomial and Cox PH models.
